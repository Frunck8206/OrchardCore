    The ModulePackageNames item group will cause the application referencing this
    assembly to treat this assembly as an Orchard Module.  Without this, the application
    will not realize that the assembly is a module and the module will not be loaded and
    available.

    This is packaged into the nuget package in OrchardCore.Module.Targets and should
    automatically be imported into the referencing project's generated msbuild files
    in the obj folder.
